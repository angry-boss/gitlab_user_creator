# Gitlab external user creator

This small app allows *internal* users to create new [*external users*](https://about.gitlab.com/2016/03/22/gitlab-8-6-released/) (introduced in Gitlab 8.6). For example in our research group we want to invite external collaborators without the need to be a system administrator.

Gitlab itself does not (not yet) allow for fine-grained administration permissions, but thanks to the [REST API](http://doc.gitlab.com/ce/api/README.html) and the [Gitlab OAuth](http://doc.gitlab.com/ce/integration/oauth_provider.html) we can write small apps like this one to meet our needs.

## Setup and installation

### Dependencies
It is common to work in a Python virtualenv. There the basic steps to install all dependencies would be:
```bash
virtualenv venv
. ./venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configuration
The app expects a file ```settings.cfg``` containing the following parameters.

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| GITLAB_BASE | Base URL to the Gitlab installation (without the /api/v3 part) |
| GITLAB_CONSUMER_KEY | *Application Id* provided by Gitlab |
| GITLAB_CONSUMER_SECRET | *Secret* provided by Gitlab |
| GITLAB_ADMIN_TOKEN | *Private token* of a Gitlab administrator |
| CSRF_SECRET | Some long string which will be used to secure the html forms |
| ... | More Flask parameters can also be provided in this configuration |

An example configuration is provided in [settings.example.cfg](settings.example.cfg).

### Gitlab configuration
1. Register the application for Gitlab OAuth.
   1. In the *Gitlab Admin area*, enter the *Applications* settings.
   1. Start a *New Application* with the corresponding button.
   1. Enter some name, e.g. "External User Creator".
   1. Enter the *Redirect URI*. This must be "DOMAIN/oauth-authorized", where DOMAIN depends on your installation. In development setups you can use "http://localhost:5000/oauth-authorized".
   1. Confirm and copy the *Application Id* and *Secret* generated by Gitlab in your ```settings.cfg```.
1. Obtain an administrator private token.
   1. Login as an admin and navigate to *Profile settings* > *Account*. There you will find the *Private token* which is needed to create users via the API.

### Launching the app
For development purposes one can use the built-in Flask/Werkzeug webserver:
```bash
python run.py
```
For this setup the *Redirect URI* in the Gitlab settings should contain something like ```http://localhost:5000/oauth-authorized```.

In production it is adviced to use some production WSGI server. Read more on the [Flask deployment documentation](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/deploying/).
